.TH sdl2-config 1 "2013-07-27" "SDL 2.0"
.SH NAME
sdl2-config \- script to get information about the installed version of SDL
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sdl2-config
[--prefix=[\fIDIR\fR]] [--exec-prefix=[\fIDIR\fR]] [--version] [--cflags] [--libs] [--static-libs]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sdl2-config
is a tool that is used to configure and determine the compiler and linker
flags that should be used to compile and link programs, libraries, and
plugins that use SDL.  It is also used internally by the m4 macros that are
included with SDL.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program or library
that uses SDL.
.TP
.BI --exec-prefix\fR[=\fIDIR\fR]
If \fIDIR\fR is not specified, print the exec prefix of the current SDL
installation.
.IP
If \fIDIR\fR is specified, use it instead of the installation exec prefix that
SDL was built with when computing the output for the --cflags, --libs and
--static-libs options.  This option must be specified before any of the options
--cflags, --libs and --static-libs.
.TP
.B --libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program that uses SDL.
.TP
.B --static-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to statically link a program that uses SDL.
.TP
.BI --prefix\fR[=\fIDIR\fR]
If \fIDIR\fR is not specified, print the prefix of the current SDL installation.
.IP
If \fIDIR\fR is specified, use it instead of the installation prefix that SDL
was built with when computing the output for the --cflags, --libs and
--static-libs options.  This option is also used for the exec prefix if
--exec-prefix was not specified.  This option must be specified before any of
the options --cflags, --libs and --static-libs.
.TP
.B --version
Prints the currently installed version of SDL on standard output.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
gcc -o main.o $(sdl2-config --cflags) main.c
is how you might use
.B sdl2-config
to compile a C source file for an executable program.
.TP
gcc -o my_app $(sdl2-config --libs) main.o util.o
is how you might use
.B sdl2-config
to link compiled objects into an executable program.
