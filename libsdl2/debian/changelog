  * d/libsdl2-2.0-0.symbols: SDL_LinuxSetThreadPriority is Linux-only
  * Add patches to exclude generated Wayland symbols from the library ABI.
    These were not intended to be public, and are not namespaced, which
    could lead to namespace collisions with other packages.
  * Don't generate symbols file from a template.
    This is unnecessary now that we don't have to suppress the symbols for
    Wayland interfaces.
  * Exclude autom4te.cache from examples.tar.gz, for reproducible build
  * d/rules: Disable full path names in documentation.
    This makes the documentation (more) reproducible.
  * docs: Only run doxygen across header files, not the entire source tree.
    This avoids a lot of noise caused by documenting generated files,
    which (again) made the build non-reproducible.
  * d/rules: Explicitly disable libunwind if it happens to be installed.
    The build includes the header if detected, but doesn't link to the
    library, causing link failure. Explicitly disabling it also makes the
    build more deterministic in non-minimal chroots.
  * Avoid using debian/source/local-options.
    This is incompatible with using dgit, and the unapply-patches option
    is mostly not useful now that dpkg-source automatically returns the
    tree to its original state after building (if patches were previously
    unapplied, they end up unapplied afterwards).

  * (Build-)Depend on libgles-dev instead of libgles2-mesa-dev.
    (Closes: #972190)

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * enable HIDAPI for low level joystick drivers (Closes: #975989)

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * d/p/no-libdir.patch: Expand description.
    Among other things this explains why it isn't an upstreamable change.
  * New upstream release
    - Delete non-free files more selectively, so we have what's needed
      for HIDAPI
    - Refresh patch
  * Install upstream's tests.
    Most of them are manual tests rather than automated tests, so we don't
    run them at build-time.
    Package them in the -dev package for now, to avoid a trip through
    the NEW queue to add a libsdl2-tests package. The installed location
    is loosely based on what GNOME installed-tests do, but must be multiarch
    until/unless we separate out a libsdl2-tests package, so put it below
    the $(libdir) rather than $(libexecdir).
  * Add Suggests on xdg-utils, for SDL_OpenURL()
  * Add myself to Uploaders
  * d/copyright: Update for new upstream release
  * d/copyright: Reorder so patterns are matched in the right order

    If a project that (incorrectly?) #includes <SDL2/SDL_foo.h>, such as
    jag_0.3.5-5, is compiled with gcc, our symlink to SDL_platform.h is
    sufficient to make it work. However, when compiled with clang, we need
    to provide symlinks to everything that is required by SDL_config.h,
    recursively, due to different symlink behaviour between gcc and clang.
    (This is a variation on #952066.)

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * d/tests: Add a test that detecting SDL2 via CMake does not regress.
    This is the sort of thing that could easily regress while solving #909740.
  * Install all headers in an architecture-specific location.
    This approach was suggested by Adrian Bunk on #909740, as one of several
    possible ways to avoid SDL_config.h colliding between architectures.
    Because this approach uses a different @includedir@ for each architecture,
    we can no longer have @includedir@ in sdl2-config.in: that would result
    in non-co-installability. However, simply removing it (similar to
    no-libdir.patch) is not an option, because the SDL 2 headers are not
    on the default include path (and they cannot be added to it without
    breaking parallel-installability of SDL 1.2 or a hypothetical future
    SDL 3). Instead, patch sdl-config.in to ask pkg-config for its CFLAGS
    and LIBS. This can supersede the previous no-libdir.patch.
    This relies on the assumption that cross-compilation will always set
    PKG_CONFIG, even if that environment variable is not otherwise used by
    the build system that is invoking sdl2-config.
    The sdl2-config.cmake.in part of no-libdir.patch can simply be dropped,
    because that file is installed to an architecture-specific location
    anyway, namely ${libdir}/cmake.
  * Mark libsdl2-dev as Multi-Arch: same (Closes: #909740)

  [ Gianfranco Costamagna ]
  * Upload part of Ubuntu delta to Debian

  [ Timo Aaltonen ]
  * rules: Disable GLES1, it's getting enabled because libgles-dev ships

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Make autopkgtests cross-test-friendly. (Closes: #946496)

  [ Felix Geyer ]
  * Drop build-all autopkgtest.
    - We already have tests that check if building against SDL2 with pkg-config,
      sdl2-config and cmake works correctly.
    - It has a large overhead as it rebuilds SDL2 and requires supporting
      cmake as a second buildsystem.
  * Add the non-multiarch include dir to pkg-config cflags for compatibility.
