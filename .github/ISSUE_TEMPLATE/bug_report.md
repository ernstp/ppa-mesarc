These packages are mainly about giving you early access to various projects and also help them out with testing. That means in most cases any issue is probably with the upstream project.

Start by searching their bug tracker to see if it's already reported, and then go ahead and report a new issue. For example with Mesa, see here: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues

**Issue with the PPA**
Of course if you think it's an issue with my PPA, go ahead and report a bug here!
Compiler flags, what's included and not, how it's packaged etc...
